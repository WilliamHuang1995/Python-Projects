# Python Projects!
Been following Al Seigart's Automating the Boring Stuff tutorial recently since I wanted to revisit python since I wanted to do some webscraping and other easy stuff. I was also motivated to do so since his video tutorial was free during black friday so gotta take advantage of that.  
Anyways, I have been having a blast coding in Python as you can get a lot done with very little. Listening to him explain through video was way more entertaining than reading the book not going to lie though.  
Anyways let's get on to business.  

Current Files:  
	webscrapper.py  

This file uses three different modules.  
To actually run this simple code, you have to run:  
`pip install bs4`  
`pip install requests`  
`pip install pyperclip`  

Make sure you have Python 3 in order to run it.

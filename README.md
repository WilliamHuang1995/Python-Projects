# Python Projects!
Been following Al Seigart's Automating the Boring Stuff tutorial recently since I wanted to revisit python since I wanted to do some webscraping and other easy stuff. I was also motivated to do so since his video tutorial was free during black friday so gotta take advantage of that.  
Anyways, I have been having a blast coding in Python as you can get a lot done with very little. Listening to him explain through video was way more entertaining than reading the book not going to lie though.  
Anyways let's get on to business.  

## Current Files:  
	webscrapper.py - a simple webscrapping script
	commission.py - a python version of the commission calculator that I wrote for my mom. It gets the job done better than Java, using less code
	 
I built commission.py into an exe using cx\_Freeze. It took a while since there were some error when I initially ran it.
